      <h4 class="service-title">Stop Cyber Threats Before They Stop You</h4>
      <p class="service-description">
        Cyberattacks are no longer a distant possibility. Every day, small and midsize businesses face ransomware, phishing, and data breaches that can devastate operations and destroy reputations. If you're a business owner, IT leader, or compliance officer, the question isn't "if" you'll be targeted—it's when.
      </p>
      <p class="service-description">
        At Safe Port, we offer end-to-end managed cybersecurity services that give you the peace of mind to focus on your business while we handle the threats.

      <h3 class="service-title">Why Cybersecurity Can't Wait</h3>
      <ul class="service-description">
        <li><strong>$4.45M:</strong> Average cost of a data breach in 2023</li>
        <li><strong>61%</strong> of SMBs were targeted by cyberattacks last year</li>
        <li><strong>60%</strong> of businesses close within 6 months of a major breach</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="service-description">
        You're not too small to be targeted. In fact, hackers often target smaller organizations because they assume your defenses are weak.
